        <h1>Happiness Makes The World Go Round: <br>2022 World Happiness Report</h1>
        <p>The World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by the Gallup World Poll data. It evaluates the happiness and well-being of people across nations, considering factors like income, social support, life expectancy, freedom, trust, and generosity. It serves as a response to the growing interest in happiness as a policy metric, providing insights into global happiness and explaining variations in personal and national well-being.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      Social support, perceptions of corruption and freedom to make life choices are attributes ranging from 0 to 1, and represent the national average of binary responses to specific questions asked in the Gallup World Poll indicative of these attributes.
      Life ladder is an attribute representing self-reported life satisfaction ranging from 0 to 10.

        <p> This bubble plot showcases several key attributes that contribute to the well-being of people worldwide, such as social support, the freedom to make life choices, and log GDP per capita. Each bubble represents a country, colour coded by their region. 

        Evidently, <b>Afghanistan</b> ranks lowest in terms of both social support and freedom to make life choices. <b>Developed Western countries</b> like Denmark and Australia rank highly in both attributes, suggesting a higher level of happiness. Meanwhile, countries like Bangladesh have high freedom but comparatively lower social support.

        <p>GDP per capita is often used as a measure to determine happiness. 
          <b>Economic prosperity</b>, as reflected in the form of GDP per capita, can translate into improved living standards, access to essential services, and opportunities for personal and social growth. Consequently, this can contribute to an <b>enhanced overall sense of happiness and well-being</b> among the population. A lower GDP per capita usually suggests a lower level of happiness. It is evident that people living in <b>higher income countries</b> such as United States, Australia, and European countries report higher GDP per capita, suggesting they experience <b>higher levels of happiness</b>. 

          Countries without data are shown to have a log GDP per capita of 0.

          This parallel coordinate plot shows the relationships between several attributes: healthy life expectancy at birth, social support, perceptions of corruption and an individual's life satisfaction (life ladder). It can be seen that <b>North and South America</b> have relatively higher values throughout all attributes in contrast to regions like Africa. <b>Asia and Middle East</b> also see large variations in each of the attributes, suggesting the <b>difference in happiness levels</b> among Asian countries.

          This spine chart displays generosity levels by region. 
          Generosity is the residual of regressing the national average of poll responses to the donation question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” on log GDP per capita.
          It is clear that <b>South America is the only region with negative generosity levels</b>, with <b>Oceania</b> having the <b>highest generosity levels</b>. The Middle East, in contrast, hovers around a generosity level close to 0, indicating that there might be a possibility in the near future for generosity levels to dip into the negative.

          This scatterplot matrix shows the relationships between perceptions of corruption, freedom to make life choices and life satisfaction (life ladder). Greater freedom to make life choices is associated with a <b>higher life ladder value</b>. However, the relationships between freedom to make life choices and life ladder with corruption perceptions are <b>unclear albeit showing vague negative correlations</b>.
